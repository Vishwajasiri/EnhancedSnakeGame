# EnhancedSnakeGame
## Description:
Enhanced Snake Game is a classic snake game implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical interface. It features a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer while avoiding obstacles and walls. The game becomes progressively challenging as the player advances through levels by reaching score milestones.

## Key Features:
- Smooth snake movement and controls using keyboard input.
- Dynamic obstacle generation and increasing obstacle density with each level.
- Level progression with score milestones.
- Game over screen displaying final score and level reached.
- Reset functionality to restart the game.

## How to Play:
- Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the movement of the snake.
- Guide the snake to eat the red food squares to score points and grow longer.
- Avoid colliding with obstacles and walls, as well as the snake's own body.
- Reach score milestones to advance to higher levels with increased difficulty.

## Getting Started:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/Vishwajasiri/enhanced-snake-game.git
3. Compile the Java source files using a Java compiler.
4. Run the compiled program to start playing the game.
